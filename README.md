# Awesome ReactJS Currency Converter

This is a test project to demonstrate the abilities of React, TypeScript, tailwindCSS and TenStack Query (formerly React Query).

## How to use it locally
To be able to install and run this app you'll need latest **node** and **NPM**.

```shell
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Once the local server starts up, you'll see the URL addresses where the app can be accessed. In most cases it'll be http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

## Development
You can build the up by running:

```shell
$ npm build
```

or for continuous build:

```shell
$ npm watch
```

At this time both these commands build the app for production environment.
